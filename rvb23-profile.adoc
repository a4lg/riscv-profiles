= RVB23 Profile

//: This is the Preamble

[WARNING]
.This document is in the development state.
====
Do not use for implementations.  Assume everything can change.
====

== Introduction

This document captures the current proposal for the RVB23 profile
family.

RVB23 is intended to be the first major release of the RVB series of
RISC-V Application Processor Profile.

== RVB23 Profiles

The RVB23 profiles are intended to be used for customized 64-bit
application processors that will run rich OS stacks, but usually as a
custom build of standard OS source-code distributions.  The approach
is to provide a large guaranteed set of relatively inexpensive and/or
widely beneficial features but allow optionality for more expensive
and/or more targeted extensions.

It is explicitly a non-goal of RVB23 to provide a single standard ISA
interface supporting a wide variety of binary kernel and binary
application software distributions (RVA profiles support this goal).
However, individual software ecosystems may build upon RVB23 to
produce a more targeted standard interface for a certain market.

Only user-mode (RVB23U64) and supervisor-mode (RVB23S64) profiles are
specified in this family.

=== RVB23U64 Profile

The RVB23U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit RVB applications processors.  This is
the most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

==== RVB23U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVB23U64 and is little-endian.  As
per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

==== RVB23U64 Mandatory Extensions

The following mandatory extensions are also present in RVA22U64.

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of F.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.
- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.
- *Ziccif* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
  coherence PMAs must support instruction fetch, and any instruction
  fetches of naturally aligned power-of-2 sizes up to min(ILEN,XLEN)
  (i.e., 32 bits for RVB23) are atomic.
- *Ziccrse* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support RsrvEventual.
- *Ziccamoa* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support AMOArithmetic.
- *Zicclsm* Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.
- *Za64rs* Reservation sets are contiguous, naturally aligned, and a
   maximum of 64 bytes.  This extension implies the Za128rs extension.
- *Zihintpause* Pause instruction.
- *Zba* Address computation.
- *Zbb* Basic bit manipulation.
- *Zbs* Single-bit instructions.
- *Zic64b* Cache blocks must be 64 bytes in size, naturally aligned in the
address space.
- *Zicbom* Cache-Block Management Operations.
- *Zicbop* Cache-Block Prefetch Operations.
- *Zicboz* Cache-Block Zero Operations.
- *Zihintntl* Non-temporal locality hints.
- *Zicond* Conditional Zeroing instructions.
- *Zcb* Additional 16b compressed instructions.
- *Zkt* Data-independent execution time.
- *Zfa* Additional scalar FP instructions.
- *Zawrs* Wait on reservation set.

==== RVB23U64 Optional Extensions

RVB23U64 has 18 profile options listed below.

The following extensions are are mandatory in RVA23U64 but are
optional in RVB23U64:

- *V* Vector Extension.

NOTE: Unclear if other Zve* extensions should also be supported in RVB.

- *Zfhmin* Half-Precision Floating-point transfer and convert.
- *Zvfhmin* Vector FP16 conversion instructions.
- *Zjpm* Pointer masking (ignore high bits of addresses)

The following extensions are optional in both RVB23U64 and RVA23U64:

- *Zfh* Scalar Half-Precision Floating-Point (FP16).
- *Zbc* Scalar carryless multiply.
- *Zvfh* Vector half-precision floating-point (FP16).
- *Zfbfmin* Scalar BF16 FP conversions.
- *Zvfbfmin* Vector BF16 FP conversions.
- *Zvfbfwma* Vector BF16 widening mul-add.

- *Zvbb* Vector bitmanip extension.
- *Zvbc* Vector carryless multiply.
- *Zvkng* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms including GHASH.
- *Zvksg* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms including GHASH.

The following options are optional in RVB23U64 but are not present in
RVA23U64:

- *Zvkg* Vector GHASH instructions
- *Zvknc* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms with carryless multiply
- *Zvksc* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms with carryless multiply


NOTE: If either of Zvkn or Zvks is implemented, RVB mandates at least some support to implement GCM efficiently through either Zvbc or Zvkg.


==== RVB23U64 Recommendations

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVB23S64 Profile

The RVB23S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVB23S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.13.

NOTE: Priv 1.13 is still being defined.

==== RVB23S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVB23S64 and is little-endian.
The `ecall` instruction operates as per the unprivileged architecture
specification.  An `ecall` in user mode causes a contained trap to
supervisor mode.  An `ecall` in supervisor mode causes a requested
trap to the execution environment.

==== RVB23S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVB23S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the
mandatory unprivileged extensions in RVB23U64.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVB23 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development
(tentatively named Zjid) which might be added as an option in the
future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory, and are also
mandatory in RVA23S64.

- *Ss1p13*  Privileged Architecture version 1.13.

NOTE: Ss1p13 supersedes Ss1p12 but is not yet ratified.

- *Svnapot* NAPOT Translation Contiguity

The following privileged extensions were also mandatory in RVA22S64:

- *Svbare* The `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svade* Page-fault exceptions are raised when a page is accessed
   when A bit is clear, or written when D bit is clear.

- *Ssccptr* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
   coherence PMAs must support hardware page-table reads.

- *Sstvecd* `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0
  (Direct).  When `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of
  holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Sstvala* stval must be written with the faulting virtual address
  for load, store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and
  misaligned exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than
  those caused by execution of the EBREAK or C.EBREAK instructions.
  For illegal-instruction exceptions, stval must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

- *Sscounterenw* For any hpmcounter that is not read-only zero, the
   corresponding bit in scounteren must be writable.

- *Svpbmt* Page-Based Memory Types

- *Svinval* Fine-Grained Address-Translation Cache Invalidation

- *Ssu64xl* `sstatus.UXL` must be capable of holding the value 2
(i.e., UXLEN=64 must be supported).


NOTE: Svnapot is very low cost to provide, so is made mandatory even
in RVB.

- *Sstc* supervisor-mode timer interrupts.

==== RVB23S64 Optional Extensions

RVB23S64 has the same unprivileged options as RVB23U64,

RVB23S64 has the same six privileged options (Sv48, Sv57, Svadu,
Sscofpmf, Zkr, H) as RVA23S64.

The privileged optional extensions are:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sv57* Page-Based 57-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svadu* Hardware A/D bit updates.

- *Sscofpmf* Count Overflow and Mode-Based Filtering.

- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR.

The following hypervisor extension and mandates were also in RVA22S64:

- *H* The hypervisor extension.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the following are also mandatory:

- *Ssstateen* Supervisor-mode view of the state-enable extension.  The
   supervisor-mode (`sstateen0-3`) and hypervisor-mode (`hstateen0-3`)
   state-enable registers must be provided.
   This extension is implied by the Smstateen extension.

- *Shcounterenw* For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in `hcounteren` must be writable.
  This extension requires the H extension.

- *Shvstvala* `vstval` must be written in all cases described above for `stval`.
  This extension requires the H extension.

- *Shtvala* `htval` must be written with the faulting guest physical
   address in all circumstances permitted by the ISA.
   This extension requires the H extension.

- *Shvstvecd* `vstvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When `vstvec.MODE`=Direct, `vstvec.BASE` must be capable of holding
  any valid four-byte-aligned address.
  This extension requires the H extension.

- *Shvsatpa* All translation modes supported in `satp` must be supported in `vsatp`.
  This extension requires the H extension.

- *Shgatpa* For each supported virtual memory scheme SvNN supported in
  `satp`, the corresponding hgatp SvNNx4 mode must be supported.  The
  `hgatp` mode Bare must also be supported.
  This extension requires the H extension.

==== RVB23S64 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
  exceptions when attempting to execute unimplemented opcodes.
